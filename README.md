# API Design Protection Patterns Challenge

## Overview
This technical challenge aims to test and enhance your skills in designing robust, secure, and well-documented APIs with a focus on protection patterns. You'll be implementing a real-world API that demonstrates your understanding of modern API design principles and protection mechanisms.

## Challenge Description
You are tasked with designing and implementing a RESTful API for a fictional e-commerce platform that requires high availability, security, and scalability. Your API should include endpoints for product management, user authentication, order processing, and inventory management.

## Technical Requirements

### 1. Core API Development
- Implement RESTful endpoints for:
  - Products (CRUD operations)
  - Users (registration, authentication)
  - Orders (creation, status updates, history)
  - Inventory (stock management)
- Use any programming language/framework of your choice

### 2. Documentation
- Implement comprehensive API documentation using one of:
  - Swagger/OpenAPI
  - RAML
- Documentation should include:
  - Endpoint descriptions
  - Request/response examples
  - Authentication requirements
  - Error scenarios

### 3. Protection Patterns
Implement the following protection patterns:

#### Rate Limiting
- Apply rate limits to all API endpoints
- Implement different rate limits for authenticated vs. unauthenticated requests
- Include rate limit information in response headers

#### Throttling
- Implement request throttling mechanisms
- Configure gradual response degradation under high load

#### Timeout and Retry
- Implement timeout configurations for external service calls
- Create intelligent retry mechanisms with exponential backoff

#### Circuit Breaker
- Implement circuit breaker pattern for external dependencies
- Include appropriate fallback mechanisms
- Monitor and log circuit state changes

### 4. API Versioning
- Implement an API versioning strategy
- Support at least two API versions to demonstrate version handling
- Document version deprecation process

### 5. Error Handling
- Implement standardized error responses
- Use appropriate HTTP status codes
- Include informative error messages and error codes

### 6. Pagination and Result Limiting
- Implement pagination for collection endpoints
- Support filtering and sorting options
- Include pagination metadata in responses

## Evaluation Criteria
Your solution will be evaluated based on:
1. Correct implementation of all required protection patterns
2. Quality and completeness of API documentation
3. API design and adherence to RESTful principles
4. Code quality, organization, and best practices
5. Error handling approach
6. Scalability considerations

## Deliverables
- Source code for the API implementation
- Complete API documentation
- README with setup instructions
- Brief architectural overview explaining design decisions

## Time Frame
- Suggested completion time: 1-2 weeks

## Bonus Points
- Implementing authentication (OAuth2, JWT)
- Adding API analytics or monitoring capabilities
- Containerization (Docker)
- Automated tests for API endpoints and protection patterns
- CI/CD pipeline configuration
