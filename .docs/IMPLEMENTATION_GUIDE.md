# Implementation Guide

This guide provides recommendations for how to approach this challenge, including suggested technologies, implementation strategies, and best practices for each protection pattern.

## Suggested Technology Stack

You may choose any technology stack you're comfortable with. Here are some suggestions:

### Backend Frameworks
- **Node.js**: Express, NestJS, Fastify
- **Python**: FastAPI, Flask, Django
- **Java**: Spring Boot
- **Go**: Gin, Echo
- **Ruby**: Ruby on Rails
- **.NET**: ASP.NET Core

### Database
- **SQL**: PostgreSQL, MySQL
- **NoSQL**: MongoDB, DynamoDB
- **In-memory**: Redis (for rate limiting and caching)

### API Documentation
- Swagger/OpenAPI
- Postman Collections
- RAML

### Authentication
- OAuth 2.0 / JWT
- Auth0, Okta, or custom implementation

## Implementation Steps

### 1. Initial Setup

1. Create a new project using your preferred framework
2. Set up a database connection
3. Define your API structure and base routes
4. Implement basic authentication

### 2. Core Entities Implementation

1. Design and implement database schemas/models
2. Create CRUD endpoints for Products, Users, Orders, and Inventory
3. Implement basic business logic for each entity
4. Add validation for request data

### 3. API Documentation

1. Choose a documentation tool (Swagger/OpenAPI recommended)
2. Document all endpoints with:
   - Request parameters and body schemas
   - Response schemas
   - Authentication requirements
   - Example requests and responses

### 4. Protection Patterns Implementation

#### Rate Limiting

1. Choose a rate limiting library for your framework or implement your own
2. Configure different rate limits for different endpoints or user roles
3. Add rate limit headers to all responses
4. Implement proper error responses when limits are exceeded

**Example implementations:**
- Node.js: express-rate-limit, rate-limiter-flexible
- Python: Flask-Limiter, Django-ratelimit
- Java: bucket4j, resilience4j
- Custom: Redis-based implementation

#### Throttling

1. Implement request throttling based on server load
2. Set up metrics collection for CPU, memory, and response time
3. Configure adaptive throttling based on these metrics
4. Add logic to prioritize critical operations

**Example implementations:**
- Load-based throttling using server metrics
- Queue-based throttling for managing concurrency
- Priority-based throttling for different operations

#### Timeout and Retry

1. Configure timeout settings for all external service calls
2. Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
3. Add jitter to prevent thundering herd problems
4. Use idempotency keys for write operations to ensure safety

**Example implementations:**
- Node.js: axios with timeout and retry, got, node-fetch with timeout
- Java: resilience4j-retry, Spring Retry
- Python: tenacity, backoff
- Libraries like axios-retry, retry-axios

#### Circuit Breaker

1. Implement circuit breaker for all external dependencies
2. Configure thresholds for opening/closing the circuit
3. Implement fallback mechanisms for when the circuit is open
4. Add monitoring to track circuit state changes

**Example implementations:**
- Node.js: opossum, hystrix-js
- Java: resilience4j, Hystrix
- Spring Cloud: Spring Circuit Breaker
- Python: circuitbreaker, pybreaker

### 5. API Versioning

1. Choose a versioning strategy (URL path, header, media type)
2. Implement the versioning mechanism in your API framework
3. Create at least two versions of one endpoint to demonstrate versioning
4. Document the versioning strategy and deprecation process

### 6. Pagination and Result Limiting

1. Implement pagination for all collection endpoints
2. Add support for sorting and filtering
3. Include pagination metadata in responses
4. Add limit parameters to control response size

### 7. Error Handling

1. Create standardized error response format
2. Implement proper HTTP status codes for different scenarios
3. Add informative error messages and codes
4. Include request identifiers for tracking issues

### 8. Testing

1. Write unit tests for core business logic
2. Create integration tests for API endpoints
3. Add specific tests for protection patterns
4. Implement load tests to verify rate limiting and throttling

## Implementation Tips for Protection Patterns

### Rate Limiting

- Use a distributed cache like Redis to track request counts in a clustered environment
- Consider different rate limit types:
  - Fixed window (e.g., 100 requests per minute)
  - Sliding window (e.g., 100 requests per 60-second period)
  - Token bucket (allows bursts of traffic)
- Store rate limiting data with fast expiration to avoid memory issues

### Circuit Breaker

- Configure appropriate thresholds based on expected error rates
- Implement circuit breakers at different levels (HTTP client, DB client)
- Add monitoring to track circuit state and error rates
- Consider using the Half-Open state to test system recovery

### Timeout and Retry

- Use different timeout values for different types of operations
- Implement exponential backoff with jitter for retries
- Be careful with retries for non-idempotent operations
- Consider using bulkheads to isolate failures

### Versioning

- Choose a versioning strategy that fits your API consumers
- Plan for backward compatibility
- Document the lifecycle and support period for each version
- Have a clear deprecation process with adequate notice

## Advanced Considerations

### Resilience Testing

Consider implementing chaos testing to verify your protection patterns:

1. Simulate high load to test rate limiting
2. Introduce latency to test timeouts
3. Force external service failures to test circuit breakers
4. Use tools like Chaos Monkey or similar for systematically testing resilience

### Monitoring and Observability

Add proper monitoring for all protection patterns:

1. Track rate limiting hits and near-misses
2. Monitor circuit breaker state changes
3. Log retry attempts and successes
4. Track API version usage for deprecation planning

### Documentation of Protection Patterns

Make sure to document how your protection patterns work:

1. Explain rate limits and how to handle 429 responses
2. Document retry strategies that clients should implement
3. Explain the circuit breaker pattern and how to handle 503 responses
4. Provide clear migration guides between API versions
